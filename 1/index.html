                        I got a letter from a young lady. It was a suicide note. I called her and said, “Hey, this is Jimmy Doohan, Scotty from Star Trek.” I said, “I’m gonna do a convention in Indianapolis. I wanna see you there.” Somebody had to help her, somehow. 8 Years
                        later, I get a letter saying, “I do want to thank you so much for what you did for me.” That’s to me, the best thing I’ve ever done in my life.
